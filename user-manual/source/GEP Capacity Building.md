# Capacity Building
Although the initial focus of the Global Electrification Platform (GEP) is on modelling, there are two other important pillars: data standards, and capacity building. Part of the emphasis on open-source tools and data is to develop standards with broad applicability in energy modelling, and technical support to our countries clients achieve the universal access to modern energy services by 2030 (SDG7). 

For this purpose, the front face of the GEP is a web platform, where the users can access to high-level technology and investment breakdowns related to least-cost electrification planning scenarios and datasets. These results allow users to visualize the access challenge across the country, in time and space, and have an important baseline for dialogue with the stakeholders. In addition, the platform is structured to host any geospatial electrification model and flexible to be adapted to different data input and output standards to ensure data accessibility and comparability of results. If you are interested in partnering, please contact the [GEP Team] (https://gep-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contact.html) directly.  

In parallel, the GEP also offers capacity building activities focused on geospatial across governments, development partners and private sector agents. The GEP team has run four capacity building events and are looking to continue with an annual training in June every year. It is possible to find a list of the capacity building events. 

1. Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, January 2018 
2. Italy, Trieste, June 2018 
3. South Africa, Cape Town, January 2019 
4. Italy, Trieste, June 2019 

Almost 20 countries in Sub Saharan African (SSA) have already participated in regional training efforts hosted by the World Bank. This accounts for about 40 % of all SSA countries. Beyond SSA, participants from Tunisia, Haiti and Myanmar also received training. The Figure below indicates the countries that successfully received training during 2019 in turquoise and 2018 in hashed.
